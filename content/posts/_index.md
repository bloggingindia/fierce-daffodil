Random access memory is the temporary storage area your computer uses to access data and information quickly as it runs. The type and amount of RAM your system needs varies depending on your motherboard. These specs are found in the product details of your motherboard, or on the manufacturer website.

## Get the Info

The specific type of RAM your computer needs depends on what motherboard you have installed. If you don't have any documentation for your computer or motherboard, search for your model on the manufacturer's website. It should list all the details for your system, including what type of RAM your computer requires, how fast the motherboard can handle and how many gigs it can effectively use.

## Why RAM Matters

Although it may seem like “extra” memory, RAM is an integral part of your system and your computer will not operate without it. These long, thin chips help your processor run your operating system and various programs on your computer by keeping the data easily accessible. The processor doesn't have to read info from the slow hard drive, instead pulling what it needs from the faster RAM. The more RAM you have installed, the more processes your computer can handle at a time and the faster they run. Your motherboard's specs will dictate how much RAM it can handle, but 4GB is the average amount for most users. The more gaming and graphics-intensive programs you use, the more RAM you'll need to keep things moving smoothly.

## RAM Type and Speed

RAM has evolved over the years, changing design and pin configurations with each upgrade. Computers made after 2007 use DDR3 chips, which essentially means it's the third generation in DDR technology. These chips are also rated in speed, which is listed in MHz. You can use a RAM chip that's rated for less than what your motherboard can handle with little trouble, but if you try to put a faster chip in, it's not guaranteed to work properly. In other words, you can put a DDR3-1600MHz chip on a motherboard rated up to DDR3-2000MHz with no problems, but a motherboard rated for 1600MHz would run a DDR3-2000MHz chip at the slower speed.

## No Mix and Match

Because of their different pin configurations, RAM chips are not a mix and match type of thing. If your motherboard is designed for DDR3 RAM, that's the only type that will fit in the memory slots. Motherboard memory slots are integrated into the board itself and cannot be swapped out. Use only the RAM type and speed specified by your motherboard's manufacturer.
